The code for the paper of
Zhou Xu, Shuai Li, Xiapu Luo, Jin Liu, Tao Zhang, Yutian Tang, Jun Xu, Peipei Yuan, and Jacky Keung. 
"TSTSS: A Two-Stage Training Subset Selection Framework for Cross Version Defect Prediction" 
which will be published to the Journal of Systems and Software.

Please kindly cite our paper if you would like to use the code for your research.

1. Running demo_TSTSS once loading the data of prior version and current version

2. Function SMRS_Main.m is used to select the modules from the prior version in the first stage
   The return of SMRS_Main.m is the selected module subset

3. Function DS3_Main.m is used to further select the modules from the prior version in the second stage
   The return of DS3_Main.m is the index of selected modules under different thresholds
   
4. The .m files in SMRS folder are the related subfunctions to select the module subset in the first stage

5. The .m files in DS3 folder are the related subfunctions to select the module subset in the second stage

6. After obtaining the final selected module subset from the prior version, any classification model can be
   trained on the subset and then predict the modules of the current version.
